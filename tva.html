            The Sacred Timeline is the timeline that the three Time Keepers supposedly decided was best. It is the timeline that they believe everyone should follow, so they make sure that no one does anything that goes against this timeline. 
            If someone does something that isn't in accordance with the timeline, they are now deemed a criminal and will be arrested by the TVA.

            The TVA claims responsibility for monitoring the multiverse and can prune timelines if they are deemed too dangerous to exist. They also take action to prevent other beings from altering the past or future.<br><br>
            What does this mean? The TVA's job is to make sure that the Sacred Timeline is protected. They make sure that no one does anything that isn't in the Time Keeper's plan. For example, Loki steals the tesseract. 
            This was not in the Sacred Timeline, so the TVA workers traveled to that moment, they arrested Loki, and then they "reset" his timeline. By resetting his timeline, they went back in time and let the past version 
            of Loki redo the same moment. However, now the Loki that they arrested could not go back to his timeline because they reset it. The past version of Loki was taking his place. Since this Loki has nowhere to go now 
            that his timeline is reset without him, he is brought into the TVA. They prepare him a trial before the jurors, and if he is deemed guilty, he will be erased from existence with a retroactive canon.
